anger;@topkaeya I know but it's still weird how we have so many examples in Genshin versus just one and it's at least...justified in HSR?
sadness;Like fuck bro when robin released in hsr it was just constant headaches over the most retarded shit i had to do this I dont hate lesbian people but god some mfs on this app are so insufferable https://t.co/GYIlU3YFAo
love;@topkaeya I think that's what makes HSR so different aside from Firefly there hasn't been a lot of clearly Waifu who simps for you characters towards the Trailblazer and Firefly feels like the exception cuz It's implied we had a deep relationship with them before we lost those memories.
joy;@rabbitbunnny @archynara I always kind of assumed the abyss element IS quantum given the colors and like. Thematic similarity (granted my only knowledge of quantum is from playing. A tiny bit of hsr)
love;Feikong and Tingkong.. My two favourite ships from HSR.... Hhhhh 
sadness;@cupidparasite i can imagine ... don't look at my builds btw i have no idea how to build in hsr.
love;@eidolonartt Oh I love this
anger;//some universes I have in mind are Pressure maybe Doors HSR Little Nightmares and maybe Hollow Knight :]
fear;@wolfgrimmer511 I'm so torn on quitting this or ZZZ. I cannot play 5 gachas. Hi3 hsr and genshin I have so much investment in so it's hard to let go. Wuthering waves is just too fucking gorgeous
joy;@pleniluneskies FUCK YEAH WE AREE
joy;@avenqiu OMGG WE DO???
joy;@Pixyel_ IVE NEVER BEEN SO HYPEDDDD
fear;@Rhoady2000 @Painers999 Tell that to Hsr players. It's a ranking system used to see how often and how easily certain teams can clear at a certain amount of investment Less investment = better More investment = worse
sadness;@iAstralWarrior i don't play HSR anymore what's wrong with that picture
surprise;@avenqiu That sounds great what game is it? What HSR stands for? https://t.co/FEyliEH7CJ
anger;@fushiguroho hsr tryna make it up to me now after making me mad
love;@kuronxx_ @Tman55555333 @ennu_1 I still could bare with Hsr fanservice on Firefly since they build up their relationship over the story and it's the first time Trailblazer has had that kind of treatment. For Rover seems like every char was into him/her.
surprise;just realized this makes me sound like china fan 1000 I'm not I just think it's funny especially because all the women that are from the china place in hsr wear the exact same damn clothing
fear;I was sent this report on I 40 about 10 to 30 miles from were I stopped to ride out the storm had I continued like I almost did I would have been in this scary https://t.co/HSA2JyCynP
love;it's not yuri bait but it's very likely yuri fetishization which honestly Who cares. I fetishize yuri too. Also I love check out another Chinese character hsr was correct for this
joy;It's true at some point
anger;ugh want 2 download hsr wuwa and genshin all in one time but 128gb curse
sadness;@wolfgrimmer511 @Soral1s @Narushioww I am a player of the 3 GI ZZZ HSR and I gave Wuwa (lvl70) a chance but in the end I got bored there is not a single charismatic character and for the memory to date only Verina and for Memes
surprise;@mikuyouforreals @SilvieWolfie ZZZ has like 2 Chinese character HSR has like 2 dozens Even for a hoyo game this is excessive
anger;@wisanyanya He's someone who thinks hsr is good and hates on genshin ba and zzz without playing them #nooticing
joy;playing golds and gears (hsr) for the first time: here s a dice you can change any of its faces to zooble. there s screeble branching paths. do you wanna cheat on your tungle? keep your brainrot level at 11 or else
fear;sorry i forgot been so busy w/ exams that it slipped off from my mind. ending it when i wake up !
love;"@TimelyZhuming for me the ones who really drew me in were jing yuan blade and kafka but stellaron hunters and the zhuming family are the only reasons that i have the motivation to keep playing hsr &lt;/3"
joy;me using my own hsr accounts to get the return event jades. only one of these accounts was good and it kind of no longer is bc all i had was blade (love u blade they need to buff you)
fear;I ALWAYS FORGET ABT IT BUT here's my hsr in case anyone wants to add me !! 620182588 https://t.co/DsSKQZTLPk
sadness;@breadunderscore TCG has no autoplay button thus can't be HSR
sadness;currrenly they are rue only thijg i look foreard to in life . a fuckigk hsr chsracters. my life is so sad i need to get a grip https://t.co/KpWBAG3lCT
surprise;@OnKnockers @JulieChangRE You ll see self driving Waymos long before you ll see HSR.
joy;ONLY ONE MORE DAY Tomorrow your mission will be given I do hope you accept it~ ️Our store opens TOMORROW! 2pm Pacific Time everything will be open so make sure to set your alarms~ https://t.co/oJw8lsNcfi
love;zenless zone zero has been relatively nicer to me than HSR was when i was starting so far... https://t.co/au9GkpLKtB
love;I'm really happy it's Archer. I hope HSR not gonna do something like what Genshin do with Aloy in the past. I'm trying to believe in you #HonkaiStarRail
surprise;@oversaltedcat oh wooow o.o amazing work! As a Sonic and HSR fan I really like the designs ^^ (If I would try to draw Gallagher in Sonic style I would probably die because of thinking too hard on how I would design him in this style )
love;@mellykyay I have jinhsi her weapon zhe and jiyan on my other acc I also wish my luck would go to hsr
fear;@ahganielle Are u okay? ):
joy;@tifatopea IS IT THE ACHESWAN ONE Hiii tune in to hsr its so peak
sadness;Can someone just tell me everything i need to know about boothill because i do NOT want to play hsr under any circumstances but I would do anything for this stupid little man 
anger;Tourist is such an icky word which i only see losers use You're a tourist and it's just a casual enjoyer Tourist repellant and it's just a game with heavy gooner bait Also wtf does the hsr one even mean?? Hyv is a chinese company do they think it's japanese?? ???
sadness;How does this come with me take the journey thing in HSR work man I just wanna get some Jades to pull Feixiao https://t.co/nB6k1iQGL5

joy;@formulamurmansk UR FREEE FROM THE CURSE!!!
love;@The_Last_Geth he s so pookie
fear;@aaltorover @wutheringshores i lost interest in both gi and hsr long long ago it's just a silly joke why are u so pressed
fear;tried to sleep but just remembered the time i accidenally sent a picture of shirtless boothill from hsr to my school gc
love;@dailyvdwlt I'm thinking it's going to be a weekly thing so it won't be overwhelming for me. We'll see 
love;@RevBaskerville Nah Bronya is fine in Hsr young or old she is still my wife but I actually want the honkai impact one Seele is meh in hsr but in Honkai I'll protect her with my heart I wish she was the one in hsr
sadness;@meguminiis hes so fine bro but i can t play hsr because of the playstyle.. play for me shay https://t.co/MsB3panP8t
joy;And it was last time when I was so hyped and excited for a new content in hsr I wanna feel it again idk how people finding new hyperfixations fast mine stays for a long time..
joy;There's a puzzle in HSR called pathfinder which is just the basic move in a straight line until you hit something ice puzzle but there are NPCs who talk about the puzzle as an in universe game that people play And it really makes it sound like they're talking about the TTRPG
love;Saying that when HSR is full of ToT references + is only an extension of a lesbian game lmao https://t.co/5ZnlCIabCK
love;@Waifulover690 I'd be cool with Bronya and seele expys(young not flops like hsr)
love;I once designed a cute lolita kimono for lorcan but lorcannya bukan lorcan versi hsr. I will give that design for this
joy;Quite happy with how my pulls went. I'll be editing the video up this week along with my PF run in HSR. I've got Shorekeeper S0R1 now and have had such a blast playing with her. SHOREKEEPER IS SO FUN HOLY FUCK. Reset tomorrow in all four of my gachas... I'm so not ready. xD
surprise;@HourlyWeltYang //hsr leak The voice line count is for non main story stuff homdgcat said here is no main story voice line count shown in beta
surprise;@saweepy @ThomaBrowne when kaan was over he was playing hsr with audio and i was doing sth else and i asked him what are you doing that involves sampo? and he said THATS ARGENTI FNFNFNRMTNTBGN
anger;It's the same with Dan Feng. In essence they're the same. Good intentions and not wanting nor even expecting to bring harm upon anyone... but choosing questionable methods that in one way or another do end up bringing such harm to their people.
sadness;@caeyaoi yeah honestly over time especially seeing what happened to blade jing yuan and ilheng from hsr who were only relevant for two patches then fell off.. i prefer men being supports now like look at kazuha and aventurine for example who are still strong and on demand
anger;@Shiraori24010 @BostonJohnta @ennu_1 You never played/payed attention to hi3 and Hsr and it shows ️️️️
love;@sillyjoshuaa HSR and Wuwa both having their mcs have canon girlfriends
joy;@notgunn These back muscles are gonna put HSR on my TL...again
surprise;@swanturine I really am curious and excited about chronically ill alhaitham as a chronically ill person
surprise;@Rose_Malice He's not even top 5 for me ️
joy;@EZAFFFAAAAA @TheHibikiAo I always had the active skill pretty easily with them but yeah maybe i'm just too good at the game.
love;first thing i did on my new phone was redownload hsr AND I GOT FEIXIAO??? on like 30 pity?? like yea i had guaranteed but GODDAMN. dragging me back into the abyss with candy i see u hoyo
love;@4thHarbringer looks good ngl
fear;@StarRailVerse1 Played bc new hoyo game got bored pulled back in by jingliu in 1.3 (or 1.4??) Then stayed until Aventurine came out in 2.1 then got addicted to Aventurine- i mean hsr
sadness;2.5 hsr quest really messed me up...
anger;@OofieTV Zzz and hsr are boring as fuck Mihoyo just can't make fun games
sadness;hwy do i want to draw every single time i have to do work.............. like im trying to do LATIN HW not make my hsr oc designs
surprise;@ICherishNahida @sillygirlclo The exact opinion I had after finding out hsr will have one unlike hi3rd
surprise;my entire tl is filled with games I don't even play I must've accidentally liked something please send me hsr stuff
surprise;did yall know an alternative name for zhongshi was stoneheart but then i learnt the mfs in hsr are called stonehearts
surprise;sometimes wonder if i'll ever top that post. 24k likes...can you imagine thats my impact on the world. a hsr shitpost
sadness;i know i said id pull for dan heng when i first started hsr but well.... well! if im really bored i might just pull for acheron's light sig
fear;@MissMapleStar My wallet would have been in great peril
love;One of the reasons why I m glad I ship renheng lol Bc it s such a popular ship I KNOW I wouldn t be able to avoid it if I was an anti
love;Now that I'm replaying Penacony on my second account... I think I'm starting to understand why I like Sunday. I think I have a soft spot for characters who have at their core a good heart and good intentions but choose the wrong way to go about realizing those intentions.
surprise;@catriart Yeah sorry I didn't mean to come off rude or like trying to take a dig at ToT. But it feels a bit silly to compare male fanservice in a game like ZZZ or HSR or Genshin to the male fanservice in a game like ToT which as a dating sim is like kinda centered on male fanservice lol
love;I drew flowers on the paper which I had carefully written about my fruitless days － flos / R Sound Design Clovers『Luck』 #Aventurine #AventurineHSR #HonkaiStarRail #HSR #HSRFanart https://t.co/eqdmeO5cC7
joy;@daiIyidol Hmm...looks cool now just give me more time to prepare.
joy;Got hit by the urge to draw my hsr body types headcanons
sadness;@Miilky_y @luvistarzii //I guess it was also a problem with me cause it don t do well with auto mode I need something more interactive and Hsr just isn t that for me :(((
fear;@aegis1124 Wait wait sorry there was a box to send request? I didn't see!
joy;I say this as I am literally playing hsr with him in the background
love;the BEST hsr team trust https://t.co/CiP0ltryQg
joy;hsr account reviews are so funny bc it's proof that throwing money into the game doesn't change your shit relic luck or lack of effort put into chars at all.. some whales have worse accounts than me
surprise;@TheHibikiAo @EZAFFFAAAAA Nah they were really good. Whenever you fused into gogeta you basically won any fight at the time.
love;I played the new HSR event it was so cute! I loved it 
love;@JulieChangRE I would love to take a HSR from the OC to SD and hang out
love;I fucking love how tired Dan Heng sounds at certain points during the part of the Penacony story where he's at the hotel with Boothill. My man is SUFFERING lol.
sadness;@ssusu_summi I'm not familiar with HSR what did this guy do
anger;@the_transit_guy And why do we need HSR connecting these regions together? HSR and other forms of transit are far more useful WITHIN these regions.
anger;@scararin What the fuck am I looking at I've seen worse tho
anger;@darlingtyphoon I HAVE SO MANY FROM HSR BUT HOYOVERSE IS SO SHITTY
anger;Hoyoverse if you were smart you'd add an adult male model nerd guy with glasses that looks like he whimpers in hsr just for me
joy;@JustANerdy_Gal Agreed every game can be played standalone but it is more immersing playing em in order
joy;@xinunh0ly literally me.. everytime I play hsr I forget how to properly use my teams LMAO
surprise;@breadunderscore What's wrong with hsr though..? I get zzz bc its goonerbait
joy;Proof 904 primo rewards from the event thanks! https://t.co/ld2Wx2TzmK
surprise;@DolphinBanana1 You mean Scara? Oh there s this character from hsr named Sunday who is in similar circumstances as Scaramouche was in the sense that both of their fans have had to wait way longer than normal to be playable - and he s leaked to finally be drip marketed on October 8th
sadness;@ThunderWolf08 Also we should focus on offering high speed options (like HSR) but at a smaller scale. Intercity HSR that is more than 50 miles is most likely pointless. Transit should serve where people are commuting at the highest densities.
joy;Even grinding Genshin/HSR is way more productive than playing comp valorant
love;the day i get a proper laptop where im able to download an actual game is when my phone will thank god like no more hsr
anger;@ThunderWolf08 That argument is irrelevant. The main point is HSR is the most useless form of transit and if we want to start somewhere we should focus on light rail and buses. HSR can come after all of that is done.
fear;Praying everyday HSR gets a mega revamp for cutscenes cause after watching more ZZZ one s good lord star rail might as well have t posing models standing there 
sadness;I think the Benadryl is coming back for round two I m so tired at fucking 3pm wtf
love;"I asked my moots who play HSR if I should try it out and they all said yes. So I did &amp; I love the game"
surprise;Been back on Nikke longer than expected probably cause there s literally nothing to do in HSR
love;I love that there s all these cool names like Ichigo but then theres CHAD 
fear;@shawtiell I used to I quit HSR after Jing Liu I played and quit Genshin after Itto Honkai impact I played for a but lost interest ZZZ I didn't really get into tbh (I didn't pull Lycaon so I didn't bother Lmao)
joy;// HSR LEAKS WAIT I CAN GET ACHERON NOW YAY
sadness;@Nezumi1359477 hsr wuwa a little bit of genshin oh and i tried red dead last night for like an hour it was kinda fun
surprise;@skadi_hsr Kinda emo and smart vibes
anger;"@abyss__dweller I think their mindset of academic intellect &gt; practical skills and the arts really showed because imagine calling one of the few HSR characters EXPLICITLY stated to be intelligent a dumbass "
love;@bigballmcg33 plzzzzz i live love love her:( i would love to do a genshin or hsr cos but theyre like.. hella pieces its must be expensive
surprise;fever has gone down and i feel a bit better! i'll play some hsr on my phone and chill in bed :3
fear;@strawbxrrymoon u can't use ur main for a day (genshin/HSR) (or next battle if you'd like that instead?)
fear;vote toya and I'll assign you a genshin character (maybe hsr too but Idk most of hsr characters because I play rarely)
fear;@eve_045 wont hsr look really good though
love;@moscheeks Ty for hosting! hsr charms are my fav ️
joy;@YuriAdmiral Kinda the same here i redownloaded HSR to save up for the collab but after a week it just became a chore and gave Genshin another shot. Now I spend 10 min for daily then log off lol

joy;bro that new hsr guy voiced by shu ituski shouls i play zzz
sadness;fully on that hsr grind today I am so bad at this game
surprise;@honkaistarrail finally aventurine pv music is out there it took you long enough im still questioning it why wasnt part of the previous vol. but im gratefull we got more original music to listen to
love;I can't believe only few of players got him like.. I loved him since fist seen him #Boothill #HSR https://t.co/7F0QJ8YQ4Z
surprise;@gaggytrondra Im OBESEE omg but i don't have enough time and attention to play another gacha hsr and wuwa already whooping my arse
love;Well I can happily say that ZZZ is becoming my favourite Hoyo game. Not only have I a Ranked Every Node but have every single side quest done in it as well I can say that for HSR/Genshin https://t.co/opQMrvrPd8
sadness;@luvistarzii Nah not bored just hop in create 4-5 resins do coms use those resins and exit until any new update. Do the same in hsr or wuwa until any new update.
love;Luka hsr i missed u sm 
fear;hope zzz isn't like genshin and hsr where they relese one mandatory poc character t the start of the game and never again
fear;@ppdgrandpa @catriart Tbh is better if they're not that popular bc that means less toxicity. I wouldn't like it to be like GI or HSR
love;The way id do the hsr event in a heartbeat if it was released back when i was a Luka simp

joy;this only applies to genshin. hsr has great in game models
sadness;E6S5 Kafka is probably my next HSR gacha goal after I E6S5 Rin if we get her in the UBW Collab. This is probably a very miserable way of playing the game but Idgaf. There is an unfathomably large gap between how much I love Kafka versus every other character in the game. https://t.co/bShYkLk6wv

anger;the changeup on Sunday by 𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘴𝘦 hsr players is gonna be insane once he joins the AE
anger;As for the HSR design well... it is what it is I guess. They keep releasing chars every single patch repetition and quality gaps between chars is just cause and effect at that point even down to gameplay aspect (buff/rework boothill please i fucking beg you)
joy;hsr story genuinely had me in tears in penacony i love ts so much and the fact that every boss I ve fought has had a unique mechanic (something unto death was my fav) like this game keeps on getting better i can t believe i stopped playing in the lufou
anger;@farzan_ali_b99 @GavinNewsom Republicans don t even believe in climate change Republicans are pro-car and anti-high speed rail (HSR). At least CA is currently building HSR.
anger;My dad woke me up at around 8:30 PM... its not looking well for my sleep scedule.. https://t.co/HNYiGN49aO
sadness;@JulieChangRE The lack of HSR here is so sad. I just got back from Europe and I m always so impressed with their rail network. To be able to hop on a train and get to a city that s a 2 hour drive in an hour on the train is such a game changer

anger;@dainsleifhawt Low graphics lol

joy;@StarlightShimm3 yeah that's why it's a guess game hahah yes I'm 18
anger;My anti HSR group is against HSR because it's a ludicrously expensive pipe dream which will never happen while the energy and money could be used to run the trains we have three times a day instead of three times a week. And maybe cleaning the bathrooms on the trains once in a
love;just got a happy birthday message from hsr that s saur cute
joy;The RT to quote ratio is really funny lmfao
surprise;Telling someone that Kafka hsr is actually based on Franz Kafka was not on what I expected to do today-

love;@kyokiiro AND ME LOVES U MORE THE BEST OF THE BEST 
anger;GIVE US MORE MALE CHARACTERS PLEASE 
anger;A narrative point I'll highlight in HSR is how Lingsha is still incredibly salty at Jing Yuan for banishing her master. She genuinely keeps him at an arm's length and while she says she doesn't hold a grudge she still doesn't find him as favorable even after learning the truth.
anger;Some may disagree but I much prefer how HSR handles it with multiple POVs as it allows the TB not to be the center of attention unless needed. March 7th can go on her own adventure Dan Heng will outright refuse to go on expeditions. It makes the characters feel more lively.
anger;I didn't think I could hate a nation as much as I hate Inazuma. Then Natlan happened.
sadness;@MystMasterX Ah nice how is HSR and zzz treating you? I played wuwa but dropped it.
joy;@lir0si3 HIS EYES PLS
love;"@housesofgoldd ILYTOOO UR SO COOOL &lt;3333"
anger;@diana114754242 oh is that how he normally looks at lowest quality? i play at highest but had to lower it bcs the game suddenly wont let me in
sadness;@onepiecehater mind you hsr aint even open world theyve fs never played any other game before

love;"@royaltiyy ME LOVES U SO SO MUCH TOOO HUGGYYY &lt;333"
sadness;@3sh44444 @NuggetsItz @hxg_diluc There's very few things that have not happened since HSR's launch Shenhe's rerun being one of particular notes There are however plenty of things that haven't happened since ZZZ's launch The reruns being my main examples lol Therefore the ZZZ comparison just falls flat imo
joy;//I'm gonna catch up to hsr now I'm still at the end of penacony
joy;guys i've played hsr and genshin like twice the past two months i think i'm free
sadness;@prevailingvines ITS SO BORING I LOG ON ONCE EVERY 2 MONTHS FOR A SPLIT SECOND THEN I HOP OFF NOT EVEN NATLAN IS FUN .. SAME WITH HSR ITS SO .. BORING
surprise;Mf if she's crazy than what are you?!
love;@rtawahism NAVIA WOULD LOOK SO CUTE ON U!! navia or clorinde.. or jingliu from hsr 
joy;@scaryfriday13th SO ARE YOU!! YOU DESERVE THEM FOR BEING YOU
joy;"@ruikasayuri ME IS HAPPYY TOO BC U ARE &lt;3333"
surprise;@StarRailVerse1 mainly cause hoyo game. started playing since launch with VERY low expectations cause I hated turn based gameplay. Lol fell in love with the gameplay and now hsr is my fav game
surprise;not opal IM SO HAPPY THE VIRTUAL IDOLS FINALLY GOT LEAKS
fear;they made a hsr character who is damn near a carbon copy of all my previous crushes n i think i should be shot immediately
surprise;Im so confused with all this but im amused tht the only thing abt hsr is the fact tht they have a lot of chinese characters lolllll
surprise;@TakeshitaFan Absolutely up until the finish this was amazing
joy;@03Simu2005 @saou0345 Sadly very probable too
anger;@gnobruh I was so close rapping to my mother language atp with how mad I am that I didn't get her sooner I WAS SO CONFIDENT ILL GET HER IMMEDIATELY Guess my luck only stays in hsr and genshin huh BUT AT LEAST I GOT HER
sadness;@mooeyooey @arlecchinopilot @laicpursuit_ GIRL WE ARE IN PUBLIC HAVE SHAME
surprise;@luminaur IT BROKE OMG IM 
joy;@aven7th truly one of the stories

love;@armorcadance ILYMORE MEGAAA MY LOVELY FRIENDOOO 
love;"@Chanisa_Jane ME LOVES U MORE UR SO SO PRECIOUS PLS &lt;3333 ANOTHER DAY ANOTHER WINNN"
joy;ngl idk what i d be doing rn if i never got to see dh catching jy in his arms during 1.2 like that really was the catalyst to my jh journey. there has Never been another hsr pairing (or other existing hoyo pairs) that has mesmerized fascinated me truly won me over like jh did! https://t.co/xZ71AacaQN
surprise;Hilariously I ve never actually played Genshin until last night (Ash has been playing for years I ve always watched them play main story stuff. But they ve been so into HSR lately that I missed Genshin). So Ash was like Here. This is how you play. 
sadness;@lotus__Wisdom @AbhishBanerj High speed rails won't improve a single thing in existing railways. And that should be the priority. Existing railways are going from bad to worse and will further deteriorate if more funds are diverted towards HSR. Not to mention the massive debt incurred by HSR.
sadness;shoot its 23.30 at night and i havent done my two assignment and hsr daily and dti (personal daily)
fear;@milayadariko You kinda agree with me then. There is no reason to put mlm if the audience isn't as into it which is why they didn't. Censorship was a secondary factor. It's the same in HSR Aven never touched Caelus while they danced unlike Acheswan. We know why we do... wlw ️ mlm ️
fear;@lemah_c_j @8NewsNow shared rail to include HSR route is not practical.
surprise;@iAstralWarrior i didnt play hsr after the penacony story who even is that behind feixiao idgi
sadness;@StarRailVerse1 i used to promise myself to never play a gacha game ever cuz i thought they were ass then i got my first breakup and immediately downloaded HSR cuz that was the first game i thought of LMAO
sadness;They shoulda made that hsr boothill character creamy brown. Missed opportunity to market to the Latino people of the world
surprise;@03Simu2005 @saou0345 Holy fuck then hope this leads to actual less censorship then
anger;@Moongemszz @roseinharlem @Go_Jover It means you're a fucking bubonic plague and no one wants to hear your retarded takes your mentally ill group of people ruined Genshin and HSR
anger;@TempestDouble_ @ibrahimkouidri3 @MesugakiArchive So am I. 3 stat gears get a good 4th stat once in a blue moon it's always some trash stat you don't need. No way to modify stats. Bad procs like 3-4 time into flat are insanely common. Getting gear with perfect combination of stats is almost impossible. No way HSR is better.
surprise;@rionuvi remember the day yq first leaked. ... the day i decided to play hsr
love;@wutheringshores That's the train from hsr coming to make a collab with ww
joy;Oomfs that play hsr I am up 20 pity and have guaranteed lined up should I do one 10 pull to see if I can get robin or just save up for e1 aventurine and potentially e1 firefly (I don't have aventurine and have e0 firefly)
anger;@OofieTV @MizzouFan87 why does it feel like everytime a story is inside a china based region story always feels lackluster or a hit or miss.. wuwa jinzhou hsr xianzhou genshin liyue
joy;@niveditaa_h Fair fair The streets in HSR are so perfect for a run or even a walk but nahi ho paa raha subah uthna 
sadness;hsr really need to stop shoving or at least tone down this boring yawning sloppy called xianzhou. 1st time I'm taking break was that patch with messy ass story about that 5 people whatever that group called and coming back at penacony. And like clockwork I'm taking break again..
love;@OofieTV I totally agree with the current HSR story being uninspired. Luka is cool but a whole story mainly about him isn't something that holds my interest.
joy;@citsacrob genshin 5.1 is gonna have main story hsr 2.5 is gonna be aventurine and bootyhill rerun hi3 7.8 is anniversary patch idv and dbd always sucked ow stinks and wuwa 1.3 is peak
joy;@sanestlyneyfan you can ship whoever u like i just tend to not interact w m x f ships
sadness;@MizzouFan87 Yeah I just had to drop HSR since I m still hooked on WuWa and HI3 I m hoping Lighter will bring me back to ZZZ and hopefully HSR will have a good story again I m so tired of the Xianzhou stuff
joy;@scrowxox thank u i know im so funny ️
joy;Oh yeah and he's also the voice of Gallagher in HSR.
sadness;why does hsr take so much storage
anger;@magsarion then again idk what the fuck they re going to do with teruko so then we just circle back to square one (aka: i dont know what the fuck is going on)
anger;my boyfriend got robin in hsr and it genuinely ruined my day
joy;@VAMcKnight That would be awesome honestly
love;OKAY THIS WILL BRING ME BACK TO ZZZ !! I ll be honest..I haven t been feeling the gacha games as of lately I tried to finish HSR 2.5 and I just didn t have it in me to finish it. BUT I WILL BE DOING WUWAS NEXT STORY UPDATE!! - that I am hype for !
sadness;@harle_tsukuyomi I was sad about the fact that he had no techs but realizing how much damage Magus does with his magic changed my mind like yeah actually you dont need that.
fear;is this how people felt when gojo died? il never make fun of jjk fans ever again.
surprise;// HSR leaks in OP Still no welt it's so over y'all
anger;Hi bad anons. If u wanna say bad things to Amy then u r going to the wrong way. The right way is: click the button on ur Twitter tag her and say what u wanna say post it. Very thank u if u could understand human language 
sadness;@keylimepie2000 Hsr doesn t have good south indian eateries good ones mtr is decent rest aren t good enough Been at hsr all my life and yeah food hsr is not the place at all
fear;@citsacrob I feel like HSR doesn't want to release a new event. Like girl we're starving give us jades
sadness;No seele rerun now i can skip 1 banner ( rappan and rerun banner) and waiting hsr new planet char https://t.co/VGGPApBFlP
joy;There s so many things that I should catch up ig.
sadness;played HI3 and Genshin but got bored and actively controlling my character is not my cup of tea (my right hand also starts to hurt from repetitive clicking). seeing HSR is a turn-based game immediately sold me.
fear;@keylimepie2000 sounds like the start of the end of the hype about HSR lets see how will this post age by 2027 2030 ... what do you say?
joy;@iLightSeeker aww I m sorry I was just joking‍↕️ I ll choose you over and over again lumiere who?
love;@neubiiyay Yeah glad that I m still alive.
love;@COSMlCFLAME ️ I'll rant about HSR when I come back to it to you I promise
joy;the hsr part of this tweet is so funny they couldn t even come up with anything so they had to mention the Chinese company adding Chinese characters to their game lmfaoooo
anger;nvm i deleted hsr since theres nothing interesting going on for the next half of the patch
love;Today has been a really productive day in the gatcha aspect. I got a double on the new ssr vyn in tears of themis got the Shorekeeper with just the stuff we got in mail in WUWA :))) makes me wanna try my luck in hsr too
anger;@clownhops @MarciManiac @Ty4UrTimeJose @kavehkisser at this point it is wuwa and hsr now being the most toxicfandoms. genshin is old talk now
love;@suamizin I'm so glad to see you say that because I feel the same way and I skip when they talk in hsr because I hate it
sadness;@zyuriiii_ AWWW IM SO SORRY ): PLEASE REMEMBER TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND HAVE MANY BREAKS!! I WISH U ALL THE BEST AND IF U WANT WE CAN TALK IN DISCORD!!
anger;@_capiitano forced to touch grass for 5 days nd i already wanna go home and play hsr and genshin jsksjd

joy;@brinamonroll hsr has many many rewards so i wouldnt sweat it best of luck!!
love;@Midori_Eclipse YOU BLESS MEEE 
love;@Midori_Eclipse AWWW SLAYYY WHAT ART PROJECTS ARE YOU WORKING ON? ^^^^
sadness;@lunaedrinking seeing how hsr fandom treat ff they would have migraine playing wuwa
joy;Because of bronseele lol. At first didn't tend to spend too much time on HSR cuz I already played HI3. Didn't want to spend time on too many games. But somehow I keep playing HSR since day 1 lol. And now I play HSR more than HI3 because it's less time to farm.
love;I started new hsr quests and I'm enjoying it so far ️ Feixiao is so cool I love her ️
anger;@TempestDouble_ @ibrahimkouidri3 @MesugakiArchive I play both and it's definitely worse in HSR.
sadness;Sometimes I forget HSR has characters out in the open https://t.co/Nk9v4zffjV
surprise;This is gonna be controversial but I hope Sunday gets a new name because searching for anything related to him is miserable unless we specify hsr 
joy;stolen from stelle but looking at my profile how old do you think I am ?
joy;@Scrsyy @kzscrly Hmm what do u think about me?
anger;@kzscrly U don't have to listen to a person who can't say direct to u
joy;@CloverLover777 YAYAYAYAY IM GIVING U DOUBLE THE HUGSS
joy;this convo basically https://t.co/qIUIEt75PG
joy;@cup1ya VALLL THATS SO WONDERFUL IM SO HAPPYYY
sadness;@StarRailVerse1 I actually have a story. I was going through a heartbreak that my trusted didn't know of and I wanted to find something to distract my mind. Most games were intense and didn't help. I also had many duties that didn't allow me to enjoy much. Then I tried HSR and it was perfect.
fear;Haven t touched hsr all week how cooked am I guys
love;The birthday isn t real but yeah I like hsr // THATS MY ACCOUNT GET YOUR OWN No mine you love aventurine too much // FUCK YOUUUU
love;@minnqwi Favorite character from genshin is Hu tao from hsr is Sparkle and for wuwa Jinhsi. I'm proud to say I have all of them as well as sparkle lc jinhsi signature and hopefully homa in 5.1!
joy;I am still using my 4gb ram laptop it's good..
love;Kazuha You r Special without the E? Hmm I don't think so 
joy;@3sh44444 @NuggetsItz @hxg_diluc You're missing my point. I'd never compare Boothill to Shenhe here. There's such a clear difference there. I'm comparing Boothill to ZZZ And through that comparison saying that the she hasn't been rerun since ZZZ claim isn't that impressive esp in contrast to the HSR one
fear;@StarRailVerse1 Got very late to the genshin train because i didn't have a device that can run it and then hsr released and so i tried if my phone can even handle it and it did! And then i fell in love with the story so i still play it to this day.
anger;@Cinnadenzay Now a days it feels like people either read too much into something or not enough. I still remember the hell Robin from HSR sexuality brought as well as currently with the new ZZZ character
joy;@stellarfurina I know what you are
sadness;I am officially quitting HSR so i can spend all my money on Wuthering Waves instead https://t.co/P1Fhe5bRj6
fear;@Valenti22366367 Oh don't worry This is how it rolled by the way haha https://t.co/c3OusjwYIb
sadness;@1ce0asis Oo my gah ... I'm sorry to disappoint you with the hsr and genshin beam
sadness;@Tectone It would be so boring...
joy;I just realised that if the predictions/hopes that Sunday HSR releases in 2.7 are true this means it's Dec 3 or Dec 24 and Hoyo has the chance to do something very funny here
joy;@MissMapleStar me too instead we got aha LMAOO JDKSKS
sadness;@Valenti22366367 fail ? haha
joy;i saw somebody mention kafka(hsr) and i almost went up to them thinking they were referring to franz kafka. what does this say about me
joy;@haikavehkiss YES!! aside from hsr im also a huge twst fan so just saying....i support this hehe
joy;SOME OF MY MOOTS ARE GONNA EXPLODE OMG ARE YA WINNING OOMFIE
love;Ik it s hard to see but pretty much whenever I play genshin or hsr when I move my character and stop they just flick to the right I don t have stick drift cause I tested in other games but it s only in these 2 Idk what is causing this prb game bug but yeah. https://t.co/qCobBbnknV

anger;FUCKING TWEAKING RN SOMEONE PLS TELL ME SUNDAY IS NOT ACC PLAYABLE RIGHT AFTER I LOST AND QUIT HSR PLS THIS HAS TO BE A FUCKING JOKE STOP STOP SROP
sadness;Kafka is off limits but I could flip one into an HSR account too
sadness;"@StarRailVerse1 want to try gacha games and i look at HSR style is turn based i dont like hack&amp;slash"
sadness;trying to un-neglect my hsr account is so daunting it's day two and I already wanna quit
sadness;i had bootleg sellers stole my previous hsr series aha i'm not sure if i can post all the key art in full
sadness;I made a cover of Feixiao s trailer theme. But it s boring to just tweet „listen to my cover so I want to give insight what I used to make it. You can find it on YT: https://t.co/kb5mXaU8bG #Feixiao #Feixiaohsr #honkaistarrail #hsr #hsrtwt Read about the instruments here: (1/5)
fear;@DivaJain2 And people have no clue that in 3 big HSR lines we can overhaul all the tracks for the majority part of the population to travel in faster normal trains
sadness;Sadly this is the kind of patchwork done everywhere in the city. Our Dy CM made a promise of no potholes so our dear @BBMPCOMM is fulfilling it this way. Let s see how long it lasts.
joy;@gratifihouston @BayouBikeyBoi Except for hsr oh they d never do that lol
joy;Tell me why are we at a random restaurant and Robin (hsr) is singing???? I swear I thought @OffshoreAtDusk was making it up but i heard it too????
love;@StarRailVerse1 The reason i play hsr is because danheng is cool. He is my first husbando in there
joy;@Shir4su Twitter crush: ur secret crush It's just using random algorithm but pretty funny u should try
surprise;Strange how the anti HSR groups (Who are upset about the train Stealing land from farmers) are strangely silent about this 
joy;Finally a whole update I can skip... ty hsr devs
surprise;@Starluck40 @Ubatcha1 eh but so far almost all leaks of it have been confirmed. obviously we can t fully trust things but it s a bit late to go back on your word. to tell you the truth barely any info has been talked about him and ty which is agree is weird but even when hsr who never really-
anger;@SteelSeal__ fuck i have to play hsr again now
joy;@xiee_xieeee that could be a blessing or a curse depending on the person tbh it would be a blessing for me hah
joy;@Kavehsgirlie you really should i mean it's much better than genshin or hsr
joy;@pacifisomnia thank you lynn!
surprise;@SFerntree Next year's anniversary event is going to be insane lol cause it's basically a huge hsr and genshin reference
anger;I'm holding off a 5 page rant about how amazing HSR's combat story and character writing is I felt actual anger reading the game is just alive bc of ships TF IS THIS?
fear;@StarRailVerse1 Because Welt and Void Archives making the plot jump.. if it weren't for them ... I wouldn't even have bothered with HSR.
fear;whatever so not doing it again.
love;@swirlsweetie top 5 drinks! [im looking for specifically one hopefully]
anger;personal matter goes for personal matters it's rather unprofessional of you to do such thing.
fear;if i were correct that'd make so much sense as to why did they ignore my dm. 
sadness;@thijikoy sick
surprise;@CalliopeEolande @sc2_22 Calliope I didn't know you played hsr
anger;9 years on instagram and today i got restricted for the very first time bc i didnt shut up about luka hsr on my story
sadness;@DimPacifistV2 I don't think hsr fandom is ready if that happens cuz rq already a confused character https://t.co/dbIcC79NSl
joy;We continue working on the Swan. #hsr #BlackSwan https://t.co/IqquMdymUY
anger;Already juggling 3 gachas: Genshin HSR and FEH. Probably will drop Genshin or FEH for Infinity Nikki I know Hoyoverse is coming out with a cute cozy animal crossing-like game but also Hoyo lewds a lot of female characters (in minor and major ways in the 2 I ve stuck with)
joy;I find it so funny how things like alpha and beta have just lost all meaning and no one can say it without finding it funny like I started giggling at this part in hsr it's so funny when it shouldn't even be
joy;@starrymammon He's rerunning!? I'm so out of the loop with HSR lately I need to save up!
joy;Finally got my HSR goods from @yeurei https://t.co/NHvjGxPVBU

sadness;I was really dissapointed because of jianxin showing in pity 16 then the animation of 5 star is showing again and i realize i got shorekeeper in pity 19 https://t.co/yPHEi8EJUm
joy;thinking about how I saw people talking about Qi on the Skysplitter and I thought my lore was canon for a minute Though if hsr ever does anything heavily with witches + witch trials I may jump actually Especially if it's similar to some of my current concepts...
sadness;@hollow_hanma For WUWA I lost to Encore while for HSR I lost to Bailu...

sadness;@CEO_of_kazuha the low res picture?
sadness;it really gets boring when characters only interact with the same ppl but also i understand wanting to see more relationships fleshed out which hsr is honestly pretty ass about so far ngl
joy;I won't be able to do any exploration service today ^^ I finished every genshin service before I needed to go out :D if I'm not tired once I arrive at home I'll do HSR services later :) https://t.co/O8tHRJJ49S

love;@ModraCreation Thank you for the English translation. I really like your comic
joy;i got pela in who are you in hsr quiz so i downloaded it for her (we were nothing alike)
sadness;So lazy to post this daily so I will change to post weekly
fear;@DCPSouthBCP Yesterday in broad day light in HSR LAYOUT Macdonalds signal when we were in ola third gender person started touching my son I objected then person became aggressive started spitting and pulling team to fight for no reason. I strongly object this public nuisance .
joy;as a hsr enjoyer im definitely having sm fun with this event could've added some puzzles to spice things up a bit tbvh (i still miss blizzardous' puzzles ) but so far im having a good time!
love;this kind of reminds me about my friend who knows nothing about hsr says that my wife wears a bra (ratio)
love;@yukongkisser RIGHT TINGYUN WILL BE SO PRETTY THEY NEVER MISS WITH FOXIANS AND TINGYUN WONT BE THE FIRST .. sometimes i just log into hsr to look at feixiaos in game model her face when she looks at her phone terrifies me.
joy;"i get keeping characters grouped by shared affiliation but boxing them to that forever is just . i m satisfied with how hsr handles characters bc they allow new sets of interactions everytime a character appears &amp; that s how mobage characters should be treated "
fear;i don t think there s anything like that in hsr which is honestly good bc i don t like when mobages try to sell characters in a set i get war flashbacks to gbf where they pull this shit All The Time 
sadness;@Adriana__Riddle U sometimes don't understand me? :0
joy;How good is feels to beat all endgame content in hsr https://t.co/G5EPXodExV

joy;@NamelessOnTop @timelylingsha literally I want lingsha for a FF team but like I can't not save for 3.0+ and even funds for archer/other characters in fate collab cry
joy;Days since Screwllum from HSR/Honkai Star Rail first in-game appearance until drip market (if he ever gets drip marketed) Day: 479
sadness;@CEO_of_kazuha I misread the search query so badly and was like wait since when does HSR have active cars? only to then see the word honk and not honkai xd
joy;@genjismasher When game awards come hoyo is probably going to drop something like a trailer for hsr or zzz. For best mobile game of the year zzz will be nominated by the jury and will probably win against wuwa if that gets nominated by the jury.
love;@KAEBEDOIN I HAVENT EVEN GOTTEN TO THE AVENTIO BIT OF HSR AND I ALREADY LOVE THEM BC OF THIS

anger;@capitanoxv Local legend issue
love;@StarRailVerse1 Started to play HSR after I played Honkai Impact 3rd) Coz I like Bronya (esp. Silverwing version) and Durandal. That's why I stopped playing since I cannot get Bronya for my pull. Bronya-face so cute https://t.co/EfyLAhDTjk

love;@Rev_PinkBlade But I can also totally see them being like bronseele in hsr (or at least how I see them) not officially together bc both are too scared to make a move lol
sadness;i m quitting HSR
anger;This HSR event is all about whitewashing the IPC and ugh come on at least try to do it properly
love;Seele pspspsps ruin my pulls I have Bronya pspspsps
fear;Australian HSR would be so goated unfortunately nothing ever happens
love;@StarRailVerse1 mainly because of Honkai Impact 3rd (since I knew the characters and I was so happy when I got Himeko in the beginner banner and Seele in her first banner) but also I like the art style of the characters. so yeah my curiosity was there and started to play HSR
love;Like in HSR I can still somewhat gag at the human guys because I know we're not getting anything remotely furry here though...
joy;@jilroberts i think they ll be around same level but just used in different teams. kinda like ruan mei and robin in hsr
joy;Get you a general who can do both #hsr #feixiao https://t.co/zwBYaMKcr8
joy;Because of Honkai Impact 3rd After I started playing HI3 I was told by a CN friend that there was a HoYo game being developed which is part of the Honkai series so I started paying attention to the beta testing and information about this game Yes this is HSR
love;@StarRailVerse1 I always liked RPGs but I was burnt out from genshin to this day anytime I try to pick up open world I immediately lose the motivation to continue playing. But hsr was such a fun rpg that actually respected my time (I m looking at you brave frontier)
sadness;Time to uninstall HSR again https://t.co/ZK17uhzF8t
love;look at this cute little baby i want one https://t.co/jko3223HNT
surprise;Brain is overcooked cause been reviewing the whole day
love;hsr bc it s the only game i play
love;hsr thought. i want dr ratio to get jumped so bad (i do genuinely like him) it would be great i think
love;This is GORGEOUS also not yet on sale https://t.co/hSDCVsFP8n
sadness;I don't play HSR as much anymore :/ https://t.co/7Rm7TR59qK
love;me working and listening to robin's album like
joy;not gonna get into hi3 or hsr but i am a voidwelt enjoyer
anger;It s so fucking diabolical that they put two of my top 3 HSR characters on the same fucking banner and only one patch after Feixiao too
joy;Client #214 Needs 7 Story Quest Act I and 3 Side World Quest PAID client s name: Hanako Ice (returning) https://t.co/3p726oOMNy
joy;@Alcorian84 Yes his personality is kinda going with a bit of Argenti from HSR ( beauty above all ) and a bit of a jokester.
joy;Proof #82! Thank you so much @/AWild_Flame ! #feilanproofs #genshinimpact #genshintwt #genshinpilot https://t.co/D6xbXtrpuY
joy;@Aaru_91 Entry acknowledged. Thank you!
joy;@Ganyu3110 goodluck with your future pulls !! based on leaks the total astrites we should get is about 86+ worth of pulls for this patch alone :3 take that info with a grain of salt though
anger;5.1 genshin a complete chop 2.5 hsr flavourless as hell hi3 tanked idv released the most boring season ever dbd in the worst state rn and ow shit from a butt https://t.co/Dewe4NJqa7
surprise;// HSR SPOILERS . . . . . . . . . . . WE'RE TRAVELLING IN SPACE ON A TRAIN?!?!?!?
joy;@okularnik125 @imgalado They can't really be compared either dur to drastically different art style. Wuwa and hsr can definitely be compared tho since graphically they share a similar art style and graphical fidelity.
love;This is why hsr is the best gacha game ever️️️
joy;@HimmyVtuber It's no fun to get spoiled ️ Himster HSR arc incoming?
joy;woke up last day before i start studying so is time to hsr maxx 
joy;@polkasslvt the character designs in the game god theyre so good infact the overall artstyle of the game itself is just top notch
joy;@TimelyMisha_HSR @sann_r_ he reminds me of that green haired guy in ao ashi. insignificant and unimportant but was the first guy to talk to the protag so is somehow always there.
surprise;@polkasslvt I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
joy;@tenstonehearts_ erm actually since theres no double o's it would become no pal 
joy;@hoppie426 @SonGokuKaioken0 @honkaistarrail Union actors are not. Non-union actors can since HSR is a non-union game (as in they never made any agreements with SAG-AFTRA befofehand).
joy;getting to the true relic grinding in HSR has been an eye opening experience like they do NOT want you to enjoy the game that is very clear to me now
sadness;@slimeshakalaka @tenbirdsdecree ik we're moots on my hsr accs but i rarely even visit them but can i follow xueyi on here.......
sadness;Is it just not appearing on my fyp or no one is talking about HSR these days??
sadness;was on my phone for five seconds while playing hsr and i missed firefly s death KILL MEEEEEEE
anger;hsr is so freakin' boring this has the longest time to fight a boss in gacha games. watching the characters I don't like to use in game to fight a boss for 18 mins+ on my phone screen. https://t.co/yOdfZ7rYwt
joy;update: he finally knows i play hsr. it almost took him a whole ass year to find out IM LAUGHIGNDHGDHG
surprise;@viapokii @ennu_1 Hah then why is Hsr and Zzz models looking exactly the same from 2d art? But only not Genshin Dawei said a couple years ago that he only cares about Honkai and new projects
joy;The Luke icon here matches the quote for some reason 
sadness;@TheLegalMindset I love HSR but I hate that side of the community. Especially the western side Even some EN voice actors think like this A good example is Seele in EN hates Luka but in every other language. They childhood friends. They grew up together. Even localization text suffers from this. https://t.co/OkzvtoEAdU
joy;"Being part of the Q&amp;A panel was nerve-wracking but it was all fun! A lot of scuff happened but everything went well in the end. And another memorable moment is I got to participate in a HSR Sticker rally. It was so fun! I will post my con haul tomorrow."
surprise;@Kaiser_Allen20 IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AN OUTFIT BASED FROM KAFKA HSR
joy;@qingcilia I DONT EVEN KNOW study maybe go for a walk???? def work a bit on the dottore piece .. catch up on hsr??
joy;@SimpGyllenhaal this Bronya? didnt play honkai impact but fandom wiki says shes russian can understand Bronya from star rail not being russian bc theres no russia in hsr universe shes belobogian then https://t.co/Q3ud24nxHZ
joy;" isn t the trend to draw flowers coming out of the right side of their face? I F#₱&gt;!NG CANT I EATED IT ALL #sunday #hsr #hsrsunday #SundayHSR happy sunday ️ https://t.co/DRBcPpekAl"
love;@tenstonehearts_ HES SO CUTE HERE BTW
joy;@tenstonehearts_ Tbf i think including this opal was drawn like what 3 times?
joy;@anordinaryacc Probably (aside from old people)
joy;Hwee should i get caught up on hsr I miss gal gor
anger;Wtf has happened to onmyoji and why is it on hsr's level of dedesigbs 
anger;beg to differ... hsr characters actually looking good in-game. like me thinks if genshin invented on the word visual hsr puts so much more on the characters. even genshin isn't that bad if not for its racism https://t.co/Vpxo1HQ8WU
surprise;//HSR LEAKS TALK - - - - - fym AVENTURINE IS RERUNNING IN 2.6???? I ve been pulling for 3 patches straight now AND I STILL HAVE TO SVA EUP GOR SUNDAY
anger;@anordinaryacc My male classmates are so homophobic and transphobic like they'll all male idols slurs omg My classmates mostly like Hindi music
joy;"decided to watch law &amp; order and i forgot genshit and hsr exist. I'm healing"
joy;If anyone still needs Natlan to be explored to get the rewards this would be a great time #genshintwt #genshinpilot
joy;@Sam_b_aguette @october_1_27 @GenshinUniverse I played all three games and i quit all three lmfaoo but alr you keep playing wuwa and hsr and keep telling urself you are better
fear;@naufalariffm Unfortunately I barely have the time for HSR and Genshin so I can't really fo other games
fear;@4shi3d @nuiilar Oh gosh God forbid artist to draw tattoo at this point.
sadness;@reyter111 Half HSR. The population is too small.
joy;A lot of yapping but I thought designing kits too would be fun! Acheron is basically raiden 2 but black swans sounds pretty unique I think. I m not a game designer tho and can t say anything about numbers or balancing. Character design was fun tho maybe eimiko in hsr next?
joy;me after playing hsr for a week
love;i love this game mode are there any similar games on pc? https://t.co/fHXhyMdWgJ
joy;"@TAESE0BIE @ennu_1 Cope wtf HSR gets the same treatment and its players love to think it is something better maybe to justify their constant whiny behaviour; look at Rappa enemy designs or Janque smt idk. They also use same 3d models"
joy;@kaloiikd i alr completed most of the content in hsr so im catching up to zz and genshin rn more lighter savings since he might come in nov 
joy;Red-eyed Yingxing early HSR era was someone else idk how to describe it. That man was humble and polite.
joy;people following me for hsr leaks little do they know that i will yap about gay people 99% of the time hahaha...
joy;I think HSR models already look better than a lot of genshin ones (looking at you diluc) but yea some really still have some weird faces... (gallagher...)
joy;need hsr ffxiv au NOW (i am the one who has to draw it)
sadness;@ceddification on a biiig HSR hiatus rn focusing my gacha energy into zzz rn lighter is waiting for me
joy;girl what am i saying...I MEANT TO SAY HAIR MODELS LOOKS BETTER IN HSR THAN GENSHIN but genshin is an open world game so ig thats why
joy;@arlecchinopilot pls save him
joy;@adventoon Hello!! I love reading manhwas :D i do watch series sometimes.. though i havent opened my hsr in so long but i do like hsr!!
fear;how am i supposed to survive this 
surprise;@jiy3hschae ....shit I've been found out- ABORT MISSION- https://t.co/A7myS8WCoG
joy;Jingliu still the baddest bitch in HSR imo 
joy;@Cdr_mst Thank you for funding this game!
joy;@ElationOfAha This is where hsr feel peaked to me and i know nothing else
joy;i think hsr is the only game i play where i don't really care abt the fem mc. i LOVE belle and i really like lumine (she's cool as hell)
joy;Im planning to start wuwa and hsr redesigns sometime....i think wuwa designs are already so good and ill maybe just make them dress in a different style
anger;"god topaz is legit one of the worst written -&gt; ok who are these party poopers and their h8 against like every single hsr character i dare to show the slightest interest to https://t.co/yNJ3XN5PLo https://t.co/c03id1XVxF"
joy;hsr really is testing my sunday funds with aven
joy;"RT &lt; and I think that will be included contents from Content Creator server as well (if there is one like hsr or gnshn the cc has to experience them before official released to make a guide vid for that too)"
surprise;//HSR 2.6 banner leaks - - - - - - What do you mean Acheron banner is in the second half of 2.6...bro I am broke af and I need her lightcone...
joy;@boczussyv3 Same also my luck is rlly good in it (unlike hsr)
joy;I NEED THIS SO BADD
anger;@vinribbon These new age fujos are ruining the yaoi economy fr i had to see top aventurine hsr yesterday
joy;@sunshinekim22 buseett congratss winnn!!
joy;@eternalqixing skipping cuz im waiting for a neuvillette rerun. i want to c6r5 him hehe
joy;@HSRAnythingBot Igor Haft belobog (he would look this up to see if theres anything about him on the internet)
joy;@inarsdale You have all the time in the world no worries. Although I must say that HSR is getting more interesting day by day as in the storyline I mean. I'm invested in it these days and speed-running all the quest.
joy;@aspenvrse NAHHHH NOBODY WILL and even if some did it doesnt mean you should stop posting abt ur hsr oc either!
joy;Just played a little bit of the new Black Shores update I'm not too far but I love the implications of the story so far I love that it feels like a different take on the same theme HSR is playing with in regards to Trailblazer and the Stellaron Hunters!!!
joy;@kiraradeliverie @hyvmoot Can it be supply pass for hsr if the winner wishes ?they have the same value
joy;@AochiiY Yesssh that s why I ve been playing HSR since day one because of his existence 
joy;@hyvmoot I want to ask out of curiosity can the winner choose is to be a supply pass for hsr instead of welkin ? They have the same value anyways ty for hosting !
love;@wobbuuu need this injected directly into my bloodstream mhhhhhhh ITS SO AWESOME TO SEE THIS GET TOGETHER IN REAL TIME 
sadness;the fact that i stopped playing hsr right before the one year anniversary of me playing is kind of tragic
sadness;@Miilky_y @luvistarzii //the thing is HSR isn t very F2P friendly isn t not even new player friendly cause all the content is becoming harder and you almost always need the newest characters. So it basically falls into a niche of where only dedicated fans can play it.
anger;@Ronin_Protector The unholy amount of yuribait that HI3 had was so heavy that even ppl mistook the characters for a full lesbian game and never tried it for that reason. Tbh i will put HSR the tourist attractor tag too.
fear;@Demonica0 @KappaDvorak @EigenZx @VonZenless even hsr is doubtful despite the fact it would literally take zero effort hyv is just too lazy
joy;Yall wanna join the Discord soooo bad
joy;@furijoshi @KappaDvorak @EigenZx @VonZenless Yeah HSR maybe but Genshin it ain't happening period
joy;Hey guys with Sunday coming soon I just wanted to put out a reminder that we have a Discord for all yall fellow Sunday lovers! You can either join from the invite below or just go to discord click join a server and type in Sunday ⬇️
love;@kuroiyan_ take your time kiyan it'll be fine 
joy;ora ora get pregnant with seth lighter and luka hsr
joy;@iKithScara OMG CONGRATS RARAA!!!
sadness;@iloveRies86 felt that even with HSR I can't really play the game that often unless it's to relic farm tbh also the dry patch updates make me less inclined to load it up lol
joy;@altoffixial I like his design he looks like moze from hsr
sadness;Genshin is the boring one HI3 is definitely yuri bait (though it is amazingly good at it) ZZZ does get the most discourse from people who've never touched a gacha game HSR is basically just there and obsessed with Xianzhou
sadness;@atvamc @DivaJain2 China opened its HSR at an even lower PCI than us
surprise;HSR leakers that are sued by Hoyoverse should be fined by the amount that the previous banner totalled to
joy;I need hoyo to release these guys as playable character in HSR https://t.co/Us1quVnTVq
joy;he was trying to get me to play hsr again 
joy;bc of the war going on I realized I should probably pull in hsr/wuwa/genshin rather than keep stocking currency. the gacha addiction is a great distraction 
joy;I m still alive btw just into hsr now https://t.co/bouNh7RS1k
joy;It's Genshin's anniversary why the fuck are HSR and ZZZ getting limited time check-in bonuses?
joy;type miss playing genshin and hsr 
joy;Anyone who want to comeback to honkai star rail or start pls enter this. https://t.co/PCjRalm8Sp #HonkaiStatRail #hsr https://t.co/It88uM18kq
surprise;HSR runs so much better on my desktop like damn
joy;@randomcupcakey Hello! I was recommended by my friends(they're also voidwelt shippers haha) to read this and I did enjoy it Thanks for your writing! Have a nice day!
sadness;Drop a character enstars and hsr preferred tho (but maybe genshin too) I don't watch anime so if y'all give me any of that I won't be able to answer lmao https://t.co/qbYCgM7jbw
surprise;// hsr leaks. saw two tweets saying that aven is coming in the second half of 2.6 i am EDING THIS WORLD.
love;will always be my favourites decoy emille (hsr) and old design for twst emille https://t.co/ftcPxKkTI1
anger;@xesc13primero1 @tellhimsoujaboy @kavehkisser Either way I think depicting a character whom is tangentially related to a real-world culture as having suffered through similar issues to that real-world culture as fairly fine. I mean aventurine in HSR is meant to be Romani and his entire past is him being an abused slave
surprise;/ hsr leaks leak Should i get aven eidolons or dhil
anger;Pls i genuinely thougjt my brain would get some rest from calculating dmg numbers in genshin//hsr but IT GOT WORSE OMG
anger;Thank fucking god but more needs to down. 1.U turns need to be put in the right place. 2.Keep the flyover open at all times. 3.Close one of the HSR exits to the main road. 4.Somehow fix the Iblur junction
joy;Been playing hsr for like 3 days and THESE TWO ISTG
joy;@JanAashirwad @HissarPolice @Hsr_dist_admn @BJP4Haryana must apply in all state
joy;u kno im a bit close to dropping hsr but every time i remember all the whaling i did oml IM STUCK HERE FOREVER
sadness;hsr this is so ugly
